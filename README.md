# Hyper-V toggle

Batch files to enable and disable Hyper-V on Windows.

The scripts are usefull for example when you want to use WSL and play FaceIT on
the same machine. WSL requires Hyper-V to be enabled and FaceIT requires Hyper-V
to be disabled.

The scripts need to be run as administrator in order for them to work. The
scripts restart the machine after execution. You can create shortcuts to the
batch files and set the advanced property "Run as administrator" in order to run
the scripts easily.
